\subsection{Star Formation}
\subsubsection{Protostellar Fragmentation and Growth}
\label{subsec:sink_formation}

Figure \ref{fig:sinks} shows the growth over time of all sink particles formed in our simulations, from formation of the first sink particle to simulation's end $5000\yr$ later when radiative feedback can no longer be ignored. 
The first sink particle forms when the gas in the centre of the minihalo reaches densities of $10^{12}\cc$, and develops an accretion disk within a few hundred years. 
In all but three cases, this disk quickly fragments, forming a binary or small multiple within $500\yr$. 
Sinks that survive longer than a few hundred years without undergoing a merger quickly accrete the surrounding gas, growing to $\sim$ a few solar masses within $500\yr$ and typically reaching between 10 and $40\msun$ by simulation's end.

As is evident from Figure \ref{fig:sinks}, there is no clear trend with $\ucr$ in either protostellar growth or accretion rate.
The $10\,u_0$ Halo 1 simulation and $10^5\,u_0$ Halo 2 simulation form only a single sink for example, while the $10^3\,u_0$ Halo 2 simulation steadily forms a total of 14 sink particles over the $5000\yr$ period.
