\subsection{Star Formation}
\subsubsection{Protostellar Fragmentation and Growth}
\label{sub:sink_formation}

Figure \ref{fig:sinks} shows the growth over time of all sink particles formed in our simulations, from formation of the first sink particle to simulation's end $5000\yr$ later when radiative feedback can no longer be ignored. 
The first sink particle forms when the gas in the centre of the minihalo reaches densities of $10^{12}\cc$, and develops an accretion disk within a few hundred years. 
In all but three cases, this disk quickly fragments, forming a binary or small multiple within $500\yr$. 
Sinks that survive longer than a few hundred years without undergoing a merger quickly accrete the surrounding gas, growing to $\sim$a few solar masses within $500\yr$ and typically reaching between 10 and $40\msun$ by simulation's end.

As is evident from Figure \ref{fig:sinks}, there is no clear trend with $\ucr$ in either protostellar growth or accretion rate.
For example, both the $10\,u_0$ Halo 1 simulation and $10^5\,u_0$ Halo 2 simulation form only a single sink while the $10^3\,u_0$ Halo 2 simulation steadily forms a total of 14 sink particles over the $5000\yr$ period.
This  can be primarily attributed to the wide variety of dynamical environments in which the sink particles form---demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:disks}, where we show the accretion disk structure of each simulation $5000\yr$ after the first sink formed.
This variation is a direct consequence of the expedited collapse discussed in Section \ref{sec:expedited_collapse}. 
As seen in Figure \ref{fig:structure}, expediting the initial collapse results in significant variation of the experienced gravitational potential; the collapse history of the gas and the dynamical environment in which the sinks form varies accordingly.
Given the lack of any apparent trends with increasing $\ucr$, this suggests the final stages of the collapse are influenced more by small-scale turbulence than the strength of the CR background.
While CRs may indeed alter the susceptibility of the disk to fragmentation, any such behaviour is unfortunately obfuscated by variations in the collapse history between simulations.
