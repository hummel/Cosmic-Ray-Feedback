\section{Cosmic Rays in the Early Universe}
\label{sec:context}
While there are several possible sources of CRs at high redshifts including primordial black holes, topological defects, supermassive particles, and structure formation shocks, the most likely source of CRs in the early universe is supernova (SN) explosions \citep[e.g.,][]{GinzburgSyrovatskii1969,BiermannSigl2001,Stanev2004,Pfrommeretal2006}, wherein CRs are accelerated by the SN shock wave via the first-order Fermi process.  In this scenario, high-energy particles diffuse back and forth across the shock wave, increasing their energy by a small percentage each time, and resulting in a differential spectrum of CR number density per energy \citep{Longair1994} of the form
\begin{equation}
    \frac{{\rm d}n_{\rm \small CR}}{{\rm d}\epsilon} = \frac{n_{\rm norm}}{\epsilon_{\rm min}}
    \left( \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{\rm min}} \right)^{-2},
\end{equation}
where $n_{\rm \small CR}$ is the CR number density, $\epsilon$ is the kinetic energy of the CR, $\epsilon_{\rm min}$ is the low-energy cutoff of the CR spectrum, and $n_{\rm norm}$ is a normalizing density factor. 

The value of $\epsilon_{\rm min}$ is crucial, as the ionisation cross-section of non-relativistic CRs varies rougly as $\epsilon^{-1}$ for $\epsilon \lesssim 10^5\,{\rm eV}$. Higher energy CRs thus travel much farther between interactions and are less able to effectively deposit their energy into the gas, sugh that the low-energy end of the CR spectrum provides the majority of the ionisation and heating.  While estimates of the lowest possible energy CR protons could gain in a SN shock wave vary significantly, below $10^5\,{\rm eV}$ the velocity of the CR drops below the approximate orbital velocity of electrons in the ground state of atomic hydrogen, and the interaction cross-section dimishes rapidly \citep{Schlickeiser2002}. 

Integrating this over all energies yields the total energy density $u_{\rm \small CR}$ in cosmic rays, which we estimate as follows:
\begin{equation}
u_{\rm \small CR}(z) = f_{\rm \small CR} E_{\rm \small SN}\, f_{\rm \small SN} \Psi_{*}(z)\, t_{\rm \small H}(z) (1+z)^3,
\end{equation}
where $f_{\rm \small CR}$ is the fraction of the SN explosion energy $E_{\rm \small SN}$ going into CR production, $f_{\rm \small SN}$ is the mass fraction of stars formed which die as SNe, and $\Psi_{*}(z)$ is the comoving star formation rate density (SFRD) as a function of redshift.  The Hubble time $t_{\rm \small H}$ accounts for the time CRs have had to propagate through the universe since their creation, and the factor of $(1+z)^3$ accounts for the conversion from a comoving SFRD to a physical energy density. As in \citet{Hummeletal2015}, we base our estimate of $u_{\rm \small CR}(z)$ on the Pop III SFRD calculated by \citet{GreifBromm2006}, but see \citet{Campisietal2011} for a more recent calculation.

 The mass fraction of Pop III stars dying as SNe depends strongly on their IMF, and while the complex physical processes at play in gas collapsing from IGM to protostellar densities have so far prevented a definitive answer to this question, the emerging consensus is that the Pop III IMF was somewhat top-heavy with a characterisitic mass of $\sim$ a few $\times 10\msun$ \citep{Bromm2013}.  Given this, we assume that one SN is produced for every $50\msun$ of stars formed.  In addition, we assume that each SN-producing star dies quickly as a core-collapse SN with $E_{\rm \small SN} = 10^{51}\erg$, 10 percent of which goes into CR production \citep[e.g.,][]{Ruderman1974}.
 
 This results in a CR energy spectrum increasing over cosmic time in the following fashion:
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{{\rm d}n_{\rm \small CR}}{{\rm d}\epsilon}(z) = \frac{u_{\rm \small CR}(z)}{{\rm ln}\,\epsilon_{\rm max}{\large /}\epsilon_{\rm min}}  \epsilon^{-2}.
 \end{equation}
