\subsubsection{Expedited Collapse}
The CR background also works to heat the gas.  This, in concert with the enhancement in $\htwo$ cooling efficiency, lowers the threshold for efficient cooling and allows the gas to collapse at slightly lower densities and temperatures, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:efrac}.  This is especially evident in the $\ucr = 10^5 u_0$ case, where CR heating allows $\htwo$ cooling to activate at densities nearly an order of magnitude lower than usual.  One important consequence of this is evident from Figure \ref{fig:collapse}, where we show the total gas mass within $1\pc$ (physical) of the minihalo's center as a function of redshift.  Defining the center as the average position of the 100 densest particles, we see that the minihalo proceeds to runaway collapse at successively earlier times as $\ucr$ increases.  This has the added effect of diminishing the total amount of cold gas available for star formation, as the minihalo has less time to accrete material before collapsing.
