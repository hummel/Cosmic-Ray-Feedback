\label{fig:disks} 
Density projection of the central $20\,000\au$ of each simulation $5000\yr$ after the formation of the first sink particle.
Upper panel: Halo 1; lower panel: Halo 2.
Each accretion disc is shown face-on; sink particle positions are identified by black dots which scale logarithmically with the mass of the sink.
In each panel the accretion disk formed in the absence of any CR background is shown on the left; the corresponding $\ucr$-modified discs are shown to the right.
Note the broad variation in both disc structure and spatial extent.
