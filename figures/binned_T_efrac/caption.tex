From top to bottom, density-binned average gas temperature, $\htwo$ fraction, and free electron fraction for both Halo 1 (left) and Halo 2  (right). As $\ucr$ increases, the additional ionisation increases f$_{e^-}$, which in turn elevates f$_{\htwo}$. Combined with the additional heating provided by the CR background, this allows $\htwo$ cooling to activate at slightly lower densities and gas in the loitering phase to reach slightly lower temperatures, as seen in the top panel.
