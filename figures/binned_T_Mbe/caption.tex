Density-binned average temperature (top) and Bonnor-Ebert mass (bottom) for Halo 1 (left) and Halo 2(right) for all CR background strengths, as labelled.
Overlaid on each panel are the one-zone calculations of \citet{StacyBromm2007}, which only tracked the gas evolution up to densities of $10^6\cc$, insufficient to observe the $\ucr$-independent convergence in the thermodynamic state of the gas as it proceeds to runaway collapse.
