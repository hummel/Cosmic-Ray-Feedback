\label{fig:collapse}
Total gas mass within $1\pc$ of the highest density point in each simulation over cosmic time.
As $\ucr$ increases, the additional heating and ionisation allow efficient $\htwo$ cooling to activate at progressively lower densities, expediting collapse to high densities.  
The sooner runaway collapse sets in, the less time gas has to accumulate in the center of the minihalo, resulting in a lower total mass within $1\pc$ at simulation's end.
