\label{fig:collapse}
Total gas mass within $1\pc$ of the highest density point in each simulation over cosmic time.
Top: Halo 1; bottom: Halo 2.
As $\ucr$ increases, the additional heating and ionisation allows the gas to fulfill the Rees-Ostriker \citeyear{ReesOstriker1977} criterion ($t_{\rm cool}$ vs. $t_{\rm freefall}$) sooner, expediting collapse to high densities.  
The sooner runaway collapse sets in, the less time gas has to accumulate in the center of the minihalo, resulting in a lower total mass within $1\pc$ at simulation's end.
The discontinuity seen in the growth of Halo 2 is a numerical artifact arising from the cut-out and refinement process.
