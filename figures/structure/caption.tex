\label{fig:structure}
Simulation structure for both Halo 1 (top) and Halo 2 (bottom) as seen in the final output, $5000\yr$ after the first sink forms.  Shown is a density projection of the minihalo environment on progressively smaller scales for both the $\ucr=0$ and $\ucr=10^5\,u_0$ simulations, as labeled.  White boxes indicate the region depicted on the next smaller scale.  From left to right: filamentary structure of the cosmic web near the minihalo formation site; minihalo formation at the intersection of several filaments; structure within the $\sim$$100\,pc$ virial radius of the minihalo.
