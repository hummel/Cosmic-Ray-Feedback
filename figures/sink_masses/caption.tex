\label{fig:sinks} 
Growth of individual sink particles in each simulation over time, with the first sink forming at $t=0$. 
Lines end where one sink is accreted by another. 
The Halo 1 suite of simulations is shown in the left panel, Halo 2 in the right panel.  
The growth of the sinks in the corresponding $\ucr=0$ is shown in grey in the background of each panel for comparison. 
There are no apparent trends with increasing $\ucr$ -- neither in typical sink mass nor in the number of fragments formed.
