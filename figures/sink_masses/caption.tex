\label{fig:sinks} Growth of individual sink particles in each simulation over time. 
Lines end where one sink is accreted by another. 
The Halo 1 suite of simulations is shown in the left panel, Halo 2 in the right panel.  
The growth of the sinks in the corresponding $\ucr=0$ is shown in grey in the background of each panel for comparison.
