Cosmic ray energy density as a function of redshift.  Our models, from $u_0$ to $10^5u_0$ are indicated by solid black lines, while the energy density in the CMB and the thermal energy density in the IGM are denoted by dashed and dotted black lines, respectively. The grey region marks the range of possible values for the magnetic field energy density in the IGM, and the dashed red line marks the most conservative upper limit on the CR energy density from \citep{RollindeVangioniOlive2006}, as derived from the $^6$Li abundance.
