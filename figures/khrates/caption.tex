Ionisation and heating rates as a function of total gas number density for both a cosmic ray and an X-ray background at $z=25$. In both panels, the solid blue lines denote the rate for our fiducial CR background, $u_0$. The solid red lines show the fiducial X-ray rates from \citet{Hummeletal2015} ($J_0$), while the dashed grey lines demonstrate the expected rates in the absence of gas self-shielding.  The dash-dotted blue lines mark the highest CR heating and ionisation rates investigated ($10^5\,\ucr$), while the dash-dotted red lines denote the highest intensity X-ray background for which the halo successfully collapsed ($10^3\,J_0$).
