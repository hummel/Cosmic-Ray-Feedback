Ionisation and heating rates as a function of total gas number density for both a cosmic ray and an X-ray background at $z=25$. In both panels, the solid blue lines denote the rate for our fiducial CR background, $u_0$. The solid red lines show the fiducial X-ray rates from \citet{Hummeletal2015} ($J_0$), while the dashed grey lines demonstrate the expected rates in the absence of gas self-shielding.  The dash-dotted blue (red) lines mark the highest-intensity CR (X-ray) heating and ionisation rates investigated. Note that CRs cause significantly less heating per ionisation event than X-rays. While the CR background begins to experience significant attenuation at lower densities, the X-ray background falls off sharply at higher densities.
