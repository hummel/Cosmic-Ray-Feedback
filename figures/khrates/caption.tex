Ionisation and heating rates as a function of total gas number density for both a cosmic ray and an X-ray background at $z=25$. 
In both panels, the solid blue lines denote the rate for our fiducial CR background, $u_0$. The solid red lines show the fiducial X-ray rates from \citet{Hummeletal2015}, while the dashed grey lines demonstrate the expected rates in the absence of gas self-shielding.  
The dash-dotted blue (red) lines mark the highest-intensity CR (X-ray) heating and ionisation rates investigated. 
For a given energy density, CRs are more effective at ionising and heating the gas; vertical placement on this chart is simply a matter of normalisation. 
Note that X-rays cause significantly more heating per ionisation event than CRs, but are strongly attenuated at high densities. CRs are significantly more penetrative in comparison.
