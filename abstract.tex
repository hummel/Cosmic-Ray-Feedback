We explore the impact of a cosmic ray (CR) background generated by supernova explosions from the first stars on star-forming metal-free gas in a minihalo at $z\sim25$.  
Starting from cosmological initial conditions, we use the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2 to follow gas collapsing under the influence of a CR background up to densities of $n=10^{12}\cc$, at which point we form sink particles. 
Using a suite of simulations with two sets of initial conditions and employing a range of CR background models, we follow each simulation for $5000\yr$ after the first sink forms.  
CRs both heat and ionise the gas, boosting $\htwo$ formation.  
Additional $\htwo$ enhances the cooling efficiency of the gas, allowing it to fulfil the Rees-Ostriker criterion sooner and expediting the collapse, such that each simulation reaches high densities at a different epoch. 
As it exits the loitering phase, the thermodynamic path of the collapsing gas converges to that seen in the absence of any CR background. 
By the time the gas approaches sink formation densities, the thermodynamic state of the gas is thus remarkably similar across all simulations. 
This leads to a robust characteristic mass that is largely independent of the CR background, of order $\sim$ a few $\times10\msun$ even as the CR background strength varies by five orders of magnitude.
