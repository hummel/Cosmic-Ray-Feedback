We explore the impact of a cosmic ray background generated by the
supernova explosions of Population III stars on star-forming
metal-free gas in a minihalo at $z\simeq25$.   Starting from
cosmological initial conditions, we use the smoothed-particle
hydrodynamics code GADGET-2 to follow the evolution of the gas up to
densities of $n=10^{12}\cc$, at which point we form sink particles.
