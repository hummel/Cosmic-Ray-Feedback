\subsubsection{CR-enhanced H$_2$ Cooling}
\label{sec:initial_collapse}

The gas in both Halo 1 and Halo 2 invariably collapses to high densities, even as we vary the CR background strength by five orders of magnitude. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:temp}, the collapse occurs in accordance with the standard picture of Pop III star formation, albeit slightly modified by the presence of a CR background.  In each case, the gas heats adiabatically as it collapses until reaching $\sim10^3\kelvin$, at which point $\htwo$ cooling activates.  This allows the gas to cool to $\sim200\kelvin$, whereupon it enters a `loitering' phase, increasing in density quasi-hydrostatically until sufficient mass accumulates to trigger runaway collapse.  As $\ucr$ increases, the resulting ionsation boosts the free $\elec$ fraction.  This in turn improves the efficiency of $\htwo$ formation, enhancing cooling and allowing gas in the loitering phase to reach progressively lower temperatures.  This is evident from Figure \ref{fig:efrac}, where we have shown the average free $\elec$ fraction and gas temperature as a function of density for each simulation. These lower temperatures also impact the density at which the gas exits the loitering phase and proceeeds to runaway collapse.  As can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:temp} and \ref{fig:efrac}

One consequence of this lower temperature
