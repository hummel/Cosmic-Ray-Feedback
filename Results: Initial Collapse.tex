\subsection{Initial Collapse}
\label{sec:initial_collapse}

Figure \ref{fig:temp} shows the gas in the minihalo collapsing to high densities, as seen just prior to the formation of the first sink particle at $n=10^{12}\cc$.  Collapse occures in accordance with the standard picture of Pop III star formation, albeit slightly modified by the presence of a CR background.  In each case, the gas heats adiabatically as it collapses until reaching $\sim10^3\kelvin$, at which point $\htwo$ cooling activates.  This allows the gas to cool to $\sim200\kelvin$, whereupon it enters a `loitering' phase, increasing in density quasi-hydrostatically until sufficient mass accumulates to trigger runaway collapse.
