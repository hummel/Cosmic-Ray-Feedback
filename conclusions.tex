\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

We have performed two suites of cosmological simulations employing a range of CR backgrounds spanning 5 orders of magnitude in CR energy density. 
Following the gas evolution as it collapses into a minihalo from IGM densities all the way up to $10^{12}\cc$---by which point three-body processes have turned it fully molecular---allows us to capture the full impact of CR heating and ionisation on Pop III stars forming in the minihalo via its influence on $\htwo$ and $\hd$ cooling in the gas.
