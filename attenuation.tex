\subsection{Column Density Estimation}
Each time a CR proton ionises a $H$ atom, an electron with average energy $\langle E \rangle = 35\ev$ is produced \citep{SpitzerTomasko1968}.  Including the ionization energy of $13.6\ev$, the CR proton loses approximately $50\ev$ per scattering. This necessarily places a limit on how many scatterings a CR proton can undergo before losing all its energy to ionisation, as well as limiting the distance it may travel.  This distance may be described by a penetration depth 
\begin{equation}
D_p(n, \epsilon) \approx \frac{\beta c \epsilon} {-({\rm d}\epsilon / {\rm d}t)_{\rm ion}}
\end{equation}
