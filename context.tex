\section{The High-Redshift Cosmic Ray Background}
\label{crb}
Following \citet{StacyBromm2007}, we assume cosmic rays in the early universe are produced in supernova shock waves, resulting in a differential CR energy spectrum of the form
\begin{equation}
    \frac{{\rm d}n_{\rm \small CR}}{{\rm d}\epsilon} = \frac{n_{\rm norm}}{\epsilon_{\rm min}}
    \left( \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{\rm min}} \right)^{-2},
\end{equation}
where $n_{\rm \small CR}$ is the CR number density, $\epsilon$ is the kinetic energy of the CR, $\epsilon_{\rm min}$ is the low-energy cutoff of the CR spectrum, and $n_{\rm norm}$ is a normalizing density factor. Integrating this over all energies yields the total energy density $u_{\rm \small CR}$ in cosmic rays, which we estimate as follows:
\begin{equation}
u_{\rm \small CR}(z) = f_{\rm \small CR}\, f_{\rm \small SN} E_{\rm \small SN} \Psi_{*}(z)\, t_{\rm \small H} (1+z)^3,
\end{equation}
where $f_{\rm \small CR}$ is the fraction of the SN explosion energy $E_{\rm \small SN}$ going into CR production, $f_{\rm \small SN}$ is the mass fraction of stars formed which die as SNe, and $\Psi_{*}(z)$ is the comoving star formation rate density (SFRD) as a function of redshift.  The Hubble time $t_{\rm \small H}$ accounts for the time CRs have had to propagate through the universe since their creation, and the factor of $(1+z)^3$ accounts for the conversion from a comoving SFRD to a physical energy density.
