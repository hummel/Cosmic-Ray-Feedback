\section{The High-Redshift Cosmic Ray Background}
\label{crb}
Following \citet{StacyBromm2007}, we assume cosmic rays in the early universe are produced in supernova shock waves, resulting in a differential CR energy spectrum of the form
\begin{equation}
    \frac{{\rm d}n_{\rm \small CR}}{{\rm d}\epsilon} = \frac{n_{\rm norm}}{\epsilon_{\rm min}}
    \left( \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{\rm min}} \right)^{-2},
\end{equation}
where $n_{\rm \small CR}$ is the CR number density, $\epsilon$ is the kinetic energy of the CR, $\epsilon_{\rm min}$ is the low-energy cutoff of the CR spectrum, and $n_{\rm norm}$ is a normalizing density factor. Integrating this over all energies yields the total energy density $u_{\rm \small CR}$ in cosmic rays, which we estimate as follows:
\begin{equation}
u_{\rm \small CR}(z) = f_{\rm \small CR} E_{\rm \small SN}\, f_{\rm \small SN} \Psi_{*}(z)\, t_{\rm \small H}(z) (1+z)^3,
\end{equation}
where $f_{\rm \small CR}$ is the fraction of the SN explosion energy $E_{\rm \small SN}$ going into CR production, $f_{\rm \small SN}$ is the mass fraction of stars formed which die as SNe, and $\Psi_{*}(z)$ is the comoving star formation rate density (SFRD) as a function of redshift.  The Hubble time $t_{\rm \small H}$ accounts for the time CRs have had to propagate through the universe since their creation, and the factor of $(1+z)^3$ accounts for the conversion from a comoving SFRD to a physical energy density. As in \citet{Hummeletal2014}, we base our estimate of $u_{\rm \small CR}(z)$ on the Pop III SFRD calculated by \citet{GreifBromm2006}, but see \citet{Campisietal2011} for a more recent calculation.

 The mass fraction of Pop III stars dying as SNe depends strongly on their initial mass function (IMF), and while the complex physical processes at play in gas collapsing from IGM to protostellar densities have so far prevented a definitive answer to this question, the emerging consensus is that the Pop III IMF was somewhat top-heavy with a characterisitic mass of $\sim$ a few $\times 10\msun$ \citep{Bromm2013}.  Given this, we assume that one SN is produced for every $50\msun$ of stars formed.  In addition, we assume that each SN-producing star dies quickly as a core-collapse SN with $E_{\rm \small SN} = 10^{51}\erg$, 10 percent of which goes into CR production \citep[e.g.,][]{Ruderman1974}.
 
 This results in a CR energy spectrum increasing over cosmic time in the following fashion:
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{{\rm d}n_{\rm \small CR}}{{\rm d}\epsilon}(z) = \frac{u_{\rm \small CR}(z){{\rm ln}\,\epsilon_{\rm max}{\large /}\epsilon_{\rm min}}  \epsilon^{-2}}.
 \end{equation}
