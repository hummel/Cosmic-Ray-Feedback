\subsubsection{Characteristic Mass}

While the final stages of the collapse appear to be somewhat chaotic, with protostellar fragmentation driven primarily by small-scale turbulence rather than the CR background, the characteristic mass of the sinks formed remains quite stable across all simulations at $10-40\msun$.
This is very much in line with the prevailing consensus for the expected mass of the first stars in the absence of any radiative feedback of $\sim$a few $\times10\msun$ \citep{Bromm2013}.  

As noted in Section \ref{sec:initial_collapse}, 
This suggests that the influence of the CR background is restricted to lower densities and has little to no effect on
