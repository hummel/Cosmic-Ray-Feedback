\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Cosmic rays (CRs) have longe been known to play an important role in the complex physics of the interstellar medium (ISM) in local galaxies \citep{GlassgoldLanger1973,GoldsmithLanger1978,CravensDalgarno1978,MannheimSchlickeiser1994,DalgarnoYanLiu1999}.  They are an effective source of ionisation and heating in various environments, from preheating the primordial intergalactic medium (IGM) \citep{SazonovSunyaev2015}, to driving outflows in the diffuse ISM \citep[e.g.,][]{Ensslinetal2007,Jubelgasetal2008,SalemBryan2014,Hanaszetal2013,Boothetal2013,SalemBryanHummels2014}, to providing an important (often dominant) source of heating and ionisation in deeply embedded gas clouds and protostellar disks \citep{IndrioloFieldsMcCall2009,PadovaniGalliGlassgold2009,PadovaniHennebelleGalli2013,Padovanietal2015,GlassgoldGalliPadovani2012}. CRs are particularly interesting in the context of Population III (Pop III) star formation, as they provide a continually replenished source of free electrons, enhancing the formation of molecular hydrogen---the only coolant available in primordial gas \citep{Abeletal1997,GalliPalla1998,BrommCoppiLarson2002}.  This improves the ability of the gas to cool, modifying the characteristic density and temperature at which runaway gravitational collapse sets in, and possibly the characteristic mass of the stars formed.   The characteristic mass of Population III is critical, as the extent to which the first stars influence their environment is largely controlled by their mass, which determines both their total luminosity and ionising radiation output \citep{Schaerer2002}, in addition to the details of their eventual demise \citep{Hegeretal2003,HegerWoosley2010,MaederMeynet2012}. As such, a thorough understanding of how the very first stars---referred to as Pop III.1---impact subsequent episodes of metal-free star formation (Pop III.2) is crucial to developing a comprehensive picture of cosmic evolution.

In the absence of any feedback, pioneering numerical studies suggested that Pop III.1 stars were very massive---on the order of $100\msun$ \citep[e.g.,][]{BrommCoppiLarson1999, BrommCoppiLarson2002, AbelBryanNorman2002, Yoshidaetal2003, BrommLarson2004, Yoshidaetal2006, O'SheaNorman2007}. However, more recent simulations, aided by increased resolution, have found that significant fragmentation occurs during the star formation process \citep{StacyGreifBromm2010,Clarketal2011a,Clarketal2011b,Greifetal2011,Greifetal2012,StacyBromm2013,Hiranoetal2014}, leading to the emerging consensus that the Pop III.1 initial mass function (IMF) was somewhat top-heavy with a characteristic mass of $\sim$ a few $\times 10\msun$ \citep{Bromm2013}. While the contribution these stars make to chemical enrichment (\citealt{MadauFerraraRees2001,MoriFerraraMadau2002,BrommYoshidaHernquist2003,Hegeretal2003,UmedaNomoto2003,TornatoreFerraraSchneider2007,Greifetal2007,Greifetal2010,WiseAbel2008,Maioetal2011}; recently reviewed in \citealt{KarlssonBrommHawthorn2013}) and  reionization \citep{Kitayamaetal2004,Sokasianetal2004,WhalenAbelNorman2004,AlvarezBrommShapiro2006,JohnsonGreifBromm2007,Robertsonetal2010} have been well studied, the consequences for Pop III.2 stars forming in neighboring minihalos have been less thoroughly explored.  As Pop III stars form in a predominantly neutral medium, the majority of their ionising output is absorbed, allowing only radiation far from the Lyman-$\alpha$ transition to escape the immediate vicinity of the star-forming halo.  At the low energy end, far-ultraviolet radiation in the Lyman-Werner (LW) bands ($11.2 - 13.6\ev$) lacks sufficient energy to interact with atomic hydrogen, but can still effectively dissociate molecular hydrogen.  However, studies have found that the expected mean value of such radiation is far below the critical LW flux required to suppress $\htwo$ cooling \citep{Dijkstraetal2008}. At the high energy end, the neutral hydrogen cross section for X-rays and cosmic rays is small, allowing them to easily escape their host minihaloes. We recently investigated the impact of a cosmic X-ray background generated by high-mass X-ray binaries on primordial star formation \citep{Hummeletal2015}; here we focus on the impact of a cosmic ray background (CRB) consisting of particles accelerated in supernova shock waves via the first-order Fermi process.  
While the uncertainties involved in estimating the strength of the high-$z$ CRB are huge,  measurements of the $^6{\rm Li}$ abundance from metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo provide a useful constraint: the observed abundance of  $^6{\rm Li}$ is approximately 1000 times higher than predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis \citep{Asplundetal2006}, strong evidence for the existence of a CR spallation channel to provide a $^6{\rm Li}$ bedrock abundance prior to the bulk of star formation \citep{RollindeVangioniOlive2005, RollindeVangioniOlive2006}. Production of this first pervasive CRB by CR acceleration in Pop III supernovae dovetails neatly with the upper limits this places on the CR energy density at high redshifts \citep{RollindeVangioniOlive2006}.

Early studies of the impact of CRs on primordial star formation focused on the production of ultra-high-energy CRs (UHECRs) by the decay of ultra-heavy X particles \citep{ShchekinovVasiliev2004,VasilievShchekinov2006,RipamontiMapelliFerrara2007}.  With energies above the Greisen--Zatsepin--Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff \citep{Greisen1966,ZatsepinKuzmin1966}, UHECRs interact with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to produce ionising photons, which in turn enhance the free electron fraction of the gas.  
Other work investigated the direct collisional ionisation of neutral hydrogen by SN shock-generated CRs, using one-zone models to determine the impact of a CR background on the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas in a minihalo \citep{StacyBromm2007,JascheCiardiEnsslin2007}.  These studies found that the presence of a CR background enhanced molecular hydrogen formation in the minihalo, cooling the gas and lowering the Jeans mass, and by exension, the charachteristic mass of the stars formed. We expand upon these studies by \citet{StacyBromm2007} and \citet{JascheCiardiEnsslin2007}, using three-dimensional \textit{ab initio} cosmological simulations to investigate the impact of a CR background on Pop III stars forming in a $10^6\msun$ minihalo.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section \ref{sec:context} we provide the cosmological context for this study, estimating the expected intensity of the CR background. Our numerical methodology is described in Section \ref{sec:methods}, while our results are presented in Section \ref{sec:results}.  Finally, our conclusions are gathered in Section \ref{conclusions}. Throughout this paper we adopt a $\Lambda$CDM model of hierarchical structure formation, using the following cosmological parameters: $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.7$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.3$, $\Omega_{\rm B} = 0.04$, and $H_0 = 70 \kms \Mpc^{-1}$.
